The Continuing Care Nursery (CCN) in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is a stepdown unit for preemies who are prepping to head home. Nurses are assigned to the CCN based on several factors including last CCN assignment, Senority, and skill set. The nurse in charge determines who is assigned to CCN before each shift using pen and paper to keep track. The CCN Availability app does the job for them and quickly shows who is next to be assigned to CCN.
